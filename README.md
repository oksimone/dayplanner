# dayplanner


Woohoo! I've completed assignment number 5 of my full-stack Bootcamp program! For this assignment, I had to make a day planner that allows the user to enter an event and saves it to the local storage. Also, each of the time blocks should be color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past(grey), present(red), future(green)! I feel pretty good completing this assignment. I'm still trying to get the hang of jquery and understanding how functions work. Below are screenshots of how I proceeded with completing this assignment.

- the first screenshot is what my planner looks like before I start coding the planner.

- In screenshot two, I've started to code the table. It sort of matches the demo. I added color for the save button and added the 9 am hour to my div

- In the third screenshot, I added the rest of the hours and the color blue to the rest of my save buttons

-In between my third and my fourth screenshot, this is what I added
    - the date and time under the header
    - added the word "save" to my save button
    - made the on click for my save button

- In the final screenshot, with my tutor's help, I was able to understand how to code the local storage for my description
    - my tutor also helped me set up a time check function for my time block conditions
    - and then to finish off, my tutor told me that I needed to add a setInterval and call my timecheck function!
    -then I added some text in the description to show the final product!
